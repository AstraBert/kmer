# kmer
The k-mer features of a set of DNA/ Genomic sequences are of great significance on revealing the hidden patterns in that sequence population. The k-mer features therefore are widely used in many applications of Bioinformatics, such as for building new prediction methods, etc. 

This piece of Python code is for generating k-mer features for a list of DNA/ genomic sequences. Given a list of *m* DNA sequences, return a 2-d array with shape (*m*, *4<sup>k</sup>*) for the 1-hot representation of the kmer features.
